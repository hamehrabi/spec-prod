# [project name] — specification workspace

> **What this folder is:** the specification for this software. It is meant to be read,
> edited, and committed alongside the code — not archived and forgotten.
> **Who it is for:** anyone about to build, review, or change this software, including an
> AI coding agent.

**In one sentence, this software:** [what it does, and for whom]

**The problem it exists to solve:** [the pain, the consequence, and the desired improvement —
no implementation details]

> **The one rule to remember:**
> Before code, write the spec. Before accepting code, run the tests. Before release,
> review the risks. After release, update the spec when reality changes.

## Start here

| If you are… | Read |
|---|---|
| New to this project | [`01-docs/01-intent/intent.md`](01-docs/01-intent/intent.md) — the problem, users, goals, scope |
| About to build something | [`01-docs/02-requirements/requirements.md`](01-docs/02-requirements/requirements.md), then the task file for your piece |
| Reviewing a change | [`05-review/02-checklists/code-review-checklist.md`](05-review/02-checklists/code-review-checklist.md) |
| An AI coding agent | [`06-agent/01-instructions/AGENT.md`](06-agent/01-instructions/AGENT.md) — rules and boundaries first |
| Looking for what changed | [`01-docs/09-change-control/spec-change-log.md`](01-docs/09-change-control/spec-change-log.md) |

**Not every file below exists yet.** This workspace holds what the interview reached.
Anything deliberately left out is recorded as a dated row in the change log, with its
reason — so an absence is always either a decision or a gap, never a mystery.

## What each folder holds

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `01-docs/` | Project direction and specifications. **The memory of the project.** |
| `02-tasks/` | Small, controlled work items for a person or an agent. |
| `03-tests/` | Test plans, expected checks, and test cases. |
| `04-src/` | The application code. |
| `05-review/` | Review notes and decision records. |
| `06-agent/` | AI assistant instructions and context summaries. |
| `07-ops/` | Deployment and maintenance notes. |

### Inside `01-docs/`

| Sub-folder | Holds |
|---|---|
| `01-intent/` | Why this exists: the brief, the intent document, constraints and non-goals, open questions, and which parts of the system are worth the effort |
| `02-requirements/` | What it must do, and the three qualities that shape how it is built |
| `03-product-spec/` | How it should work for users |
| `04-technical-spec/` | How it is built: architecture, interface, runtime, and the checks that keep those true |
| `05-architecture/` | Decisions, each with its context and consequences |
| `06-api-and-data-design/` | Entities, endpoints, contracts, external services |
| `07-security-and-reliability/` | Who can do what, and what happens when something fails |
| `08-traceability/` | Requirement → test → code, in both directions |
| `09-change-control/` | Versions, stage acceptance, and every deliberate skip |
| `10-reference/` | Glossary, tools, and the process itself |

## Where does this information belong?

The question that keeps a specification usable is not **"is this written down?"** but
**"would the next person look for it here?"**

| If you are writing about… | Put it in |
|---|---|
| The problem, users, non-goals | `01-docs/01-intent/` |
| A behaviour the system must have | `01-docs/02-requirements/requirements.md` (REQ-…) |
| User journeys, personas, priorities | `01-docs/03-product-spec/product-spec.md` (US-…) |
| Architecture, modules, data flow | `01-docs/04-technical-spec/technical-spec.md` |
| A design choice and its trade-offs | `01-docs/05-architecture/architecture-decisions/` |
| Endpoints, contracts, status codes | `01-docs/06-api-and-data-design/api-specification.md` |
| Entities, fields, indexes, retention | `01-docs/06-api-and-data-design/database-design.md` |
| Who can do what | `01-docs/07-security-and-reliability/security-specification.md` |
| What happens when something fails | `01-docs/07-security-and-reliability/reliability-specification.md` |
| The next unit of work for an agent | `02-tasks/02-task-files/TASK-###.md` |
| How a requirement will be proven | `03-tests/01-plan/test-specification.md` |
| Whether generated code is acceptable | `05-review/02-checklists/code-review-checklist.md` |
| How the release ships and rolls back | `07-ops/01-deployment/` |
| Rules the AI agent must always follow | `06-agent/01-instructions/AGENT.md` |
| The context an agent gets for one task | `06-agent/02-context/context-pack.md` |

## Reading order

Each document is an input to the next. Read down the chain; write down it too.

```
01-docs/01-intent/          why this exists
        ↓
01-docs/02-requirements/    what it must do
        ↓
01-docs/03-product-spec/    how it works for users
        ↓
01-docs/04-technical-spec/  how it is built
   ├─ 05-architecture/         and why, decision by decision
   ├─ 06-api-and-data-design/  contracts and entities
   └─ 07-security-and-reliability/
        ↓
01-docs/08-traceability/    kept current from here on
        ↓
03-tests/                   how it is proven
        ↓
02-tasks/                   what gets built next
        ↓
04-src/                     the code
        ↓
05-review/  →  07-ops/      review, ship, operate
        ↓

## Stage gates — do not pass until true

| Gate | Condition |
|---|---|
| Intent → Requirements | Problem, users, goals, constraints and non-goals are written. |
| Requirements → Product spec | Every requirement is testable and has acceptance criteria. |
| Product spec → Technical spec | Main user flows and first-version scope are clear. |
| Technical spec → Tasks | Architecture, data, APIs, security and errors are defined. |
| Tasks → Tests | Each task is small, bounded, and has done criteria. |
| Tests → Code | You can answer: *"How will I know this works without trusting the agent blindly?"* |
| Code → Review | Only approved files changed; tests added or updated. |
| Review → Deploy | Requirements met, tests pass, rollback written. |
| Deploy → Maintain | Monitoring is live and the specs match deployed behaviour. |

---

## Rules that apply at every stage

- **Do not ask an AI agent to build a feature** until you can explain the requirement,
  acceptance criteria, expected tests, failure states, and review standard.
- **Do not ask an agent to "build the whole app."** One bounded task at a time.
- **Exploration is not implementation.** Brainstorm freely, then write the requirement
  before asking for code.
- **The ambiguity test:** could two competent developers build two different things from
  this instruction? If yes, add detail.
- **The one-outcome rule:** if a task has more than one major outcome, split it.
- **Testability is the first quality filter.** If you cannot test a requirement, rewrite it.
- **Refactor only after tests exist.** Behaviour change is not refactoring.
- **A fix is incomplete** until code, tests, and specification agree.
- **When behaviour changes, update the spec** — in the same change, not later.

### The central question

> Can this feature be traced from requirement → specification → task → test → code →
> review → deployment?
>
> If yes, the specification is doing its job. If no, there is a gap to find.

# WORKED EXAMPLE — ProjectBoard

> The running example. Everything below is filled in; the blueprint above is what you copy.

**Project name:** ProjectBoard

**In one sentence, this software:** A shared workspace where a small consulting team creates
tasks, assigns owners, and sees what is overdue.

**The problem it exists to solve:** Small teams track work in scattered chats, notebooks and
spreadsheets, which causes missed deadlines and unclear ownership. The system should make
responsibilities and progress visible in one place.

## Start here, as filled

| If you are… | Read |
|---|---|
| New to this project | `01-docs/01-intent/intent.md` — five minutes, and the only file that explains *why* |
| About to build something | `01-docs/02-requirements/requirements.md`, then `02-tasks/02-task-files/TASK-006.md` |
| Reviewing a change | `05-review/02-checklists/code-review-checklist.md` |
| An AI coding agent | `06-agent/01-instructions/AGENT.md` — the do-not-change list is not advisory |

**What is deliberately absent:** `frontend-component-spec.md` was skipped — the first version
is server-rendered and has no component layer to describe. Recorded as a dated row in
`01-docs/09-change-control/spec-change-log.md` on 2026-03-14, with that reason.

> **What this file caught.** Three weeks in, a new contributor added a rate-limiting note to
> `technical-spec.md`, because that was the file they had open. The *"where does this
> belong?"* table moved it to `runtime-and-scale.md` — where the person tuning limits would
> actually look. A specification nobody can navigate is one nobody updates, and a
> specification nobody updates stops being true within a month.
