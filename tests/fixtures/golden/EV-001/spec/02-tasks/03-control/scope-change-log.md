# Scope Change Log

> Source: Ch. 14 §14.7 (Preventing Scope Creep) + Ch. 29 §29.6 (Handling Scope Changes).
> Scope changes are not automatically bad. They become dangerous when they enter the
> project **without a decision trail**.

> **Scope control rule:** a scope change is not accepted until the relevant requirement,
> design, tests, tasks, and review checklist are updated. Otherwise the change is only a
> conversation, not a controlled decision.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|

No scope changes have been requested for version one. Every new idea passes through this log
before it becomes a task — the next accepted change is recorded as `SC-001`.

## Evaluation questions (Ch. 29 §29.6)

| Question | Why it matters | Decision option | Artifact to update | Risk if ignored |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Does it support the project goal? | Prevents attractive but distracting work. | Accept / reject / defer. | Project vision and PRD. | The team builds low-value features. |
| Does it affect existing requirements? | Prevents hidden behavior changes. | Revise requirement or create new one. | Requirements and traceability matrix. | Tests no longer match expected behavior. |
| Does it affect architecture? | Prevents rushed design damage. | Update design or create an ADR. | Technical spec and ADR log. | The code becomes inconsistent. |
| Does it affect release timing? | Prevents false delivery promises. | Move release, reduce scope, or defer. | Roadmap and task plan. | The team ships unfinished work. |
| Does it require new tests? | Prevents unverified changes. | Add test cases before implementation. | Test spec and checklist. | New behavior breaks silently. |

## Preventing scope creep from the agent (Ch. 14 §14.7)

Scope creep happens quickly with AI agents because they may "helpfully" add extra fields,
extra screens, or extra logic that was never requested — for Pantry, sharing, nutrition,
pricing, or importing recipes would each be exactly this.

**Rule:** every task must point back to an approved requirement or design decision. If a
requested change has no matching spec entry, **pause the implementation** — reject it,
defer it, or update the spec first.

> **No new code without a matching approved reason.**

New ideas must pass *through the specification* before they become implementation tasks:

```
new idea → evaluate against intent & goals → accept/defer/reject
                  ↓ (accepted)
        update requirement + spec + tests
                  ↓
             create task
                  ↓
           implementation
```
